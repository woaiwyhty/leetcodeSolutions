its a really bad problem.
You have many different choice when u do add or get operations, so, if we want to get the best solution, we must know the number of get operations is greater than that of add opeartions or not.
if there are too many add operations, we can use O(logn) add and nlogn get.
if there are too many get operations, we can achieve O(n) add and O(1) get
